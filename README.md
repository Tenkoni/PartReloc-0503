Scheduler and Memory simulator
This is a project I made for my Computer Architecture class, it is a process scheduler and memory simulator.
It uses dynamical and relocatable memory with the first-fit algorithm to fit the process in the simulated memory.
For the processing it uses processing time quantums, somewhat similar to Round Robin.

This is just for educational purposes and somebody might use it as a learning resource or learn from the mistakes I made. You're
free to use this program as you please except for plagiarism of school projects or homeworks.
